# Install Jumpcut Puppet Module for Boxen

Jumpcut is an application that provides "clipboard buffering" â€” that is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your clipboard's history.

See http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/ for more. 

## Usage

```include jumpcut```


## Development
